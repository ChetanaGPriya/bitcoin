##Key findings
Energy Impact: Bitcoin mining’s energy use rivals nations like Argentina, with emissions increasing 126% (2016-2021).
Market Dynamics: Rising Bitcoin prices drive higher energy consumption and environmental harm.
Technological Limits: Solutions like SegWit improve efficiency but don’t reduce proof-of-work energy demands.
Sustainability: Renewable energy adoption, seen in Iceland and Norway, is limited by economic and infrastructure barriers.


##Methodology used

Correlation Analysis

Identified linear and monotonic relationships among variables

OLS Regression

Ordinary Least Squares - Quantified relationships using R-squared and coefficients for interpretability.

Predictive Models

Used to capture nonlinear dynamics and assess feature importance.

Causality testing

Determined temporal links, whether one variable can predict or cause changes in another.

As the variables all follow a trend, these analyses were performed both on the collected data and their daily differences to avoid multicollinearity.
